## Overview

The challenge is to build a visual interface from scratch following as closely as possible the guidelines defined in the design that Dofleini S.R.L shared for this purpose.

### Folders

**PUBLIC FOLDER** 

This folder contains the public files of the project, such as HTML files, CSS files, images, and other resources that will be displayed directly in the browser.


**SRC FOLDER**

This is the main project folder and contains all the source code. The is subdivided into the following folders in order to facilitate the organization, understanding and maintenance of the project.

*ASSETS FOLDER*
The "assets" folder is responsible for storing all the resources (images, avatars and icons) used in the project. This makes it easier to organize and maintain the project, since all the resources are in one place.

*THEMES FOLDER*
The themes folder is used to store the different themes or visual styles of a web application and to define and apply the corresponding visual style. Using themes makes it easy to customize the user interface and makes it easier to create a coherent and consistent user interface throughout your application.

*ROUTES FOLDER*
The routes folder is used to organize the different routes or pages of the web application and to define the content that is displayed in each of them.

*PAGES FOLDER*
The pages folder is used to organize the different pages of the application. Each file or module in the pages folder represents a page of the application and contains the code necessary to render the content of that page.

*COMPONENTS FOLDER*
The idea behind the "components" folder is to have a centralized place to store all the reusable UI components of the project. This makes it easier to organize and maintain the project, since all the components are in one place. Additionally, it allows components to be reused in different parts of the project, which improves development consistency and efficiency.
